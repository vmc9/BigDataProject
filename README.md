# BigDataProject
### A dataset analysis project leveraging Big Data techniques.

Using data analysis techniques, we plan on performing a dataset analysis on security / cyber attack data, such as IoT device botnet attacks with data compiled from the UCI repository. 

Possible datasets include:

# [detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT#)
### Summary:
- Classification is possible on this data set since it is composed of data from 10 different attacks, carries out by 2 separate botnets, so training a model for multi-class classification to recognize different attacks is possible
- Simply classifing the input as "benign" or "malicious" is also a possibility
- The data set is composed of network traffic data from 9 different IoT devices, such as a thermostat, a doorbell, etc.

### Details:
- 7062606 data instances
- 115 attributes
- from 2018-03-19
- possible tasks: 
 - Classification
 - Clustering


# [Kitsune Network Attack Dataset Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Kitsune+Network+Attack+Dataset)
### Summary:
- Dataset is comprised of network packets involved in 9 diferent network capture methods of network attacks: OS Scann Nmap, Fuzzing SFuzz, Mirai Telnet, etc
- Benign / Malicious labels are provided so classification is possible

### Details:
- 27170754 data instances
- 115 attributes
- from 2019-10-16
- possible tasks:
  - Classification
  - Clustering
